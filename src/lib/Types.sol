///      (e.g. SignatureQuorumValidator.SignatureConfig) at the call site.
/// @dev Adding a field here also means adding a comparison in `DriftCheck` and a case in

///      the drift check incomplete.

///      deploy constructed, not declared intent, so differing from current config is
///      normal rather than drift.
